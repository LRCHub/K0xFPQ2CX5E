I won't lie
Love is hard to do
Girl don't cry
Sometimes love isn't true

I know that you can handle
Almost anything at all
But when it don't go like you planned
And you don't understand what to do

Wherever you are
You can run to me
I'm never too far
You can come to me
When he's walking out on you
Remember you can always run to me

On the day you realize
What unhappiness can do to anyone
And life is not so fun

I know that you can handle
Almost anything at all
But when it don't go like you planned
And you don't understand what to do

Wherever you are
You can run to me
I'm never too far
You can come to me
When he's walking out on you
Remember you can always run to me

If there's a God out there
He must have heard my prayer
Because I found you

Through the fog and haze
And all the lonely days
Somehow I found you
